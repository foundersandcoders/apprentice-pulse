Update the file `./docs/report.md` with the modifications done since the last commit.

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff HEAD` to see all changes since the last commit
2. Run `git diff --name-only HEAD` to get a list of modified files
3. Read the current `./docs/report.md` to understand the existing structure
4. Read `./docs/Assesment-criteria.md` to understand the assessment criteria (P1-P11, D1-D4)
5. If needed, check `./docs/ksbs.md` for specific KSB definitions

## Writing Guidelines

- Be concise but thorough - explain what was implemented without being verbose
- Add code snippets where they help illustrate the implementation
- Include diagrams (mermaid) if they clarify architecture or flow
- Use bullet points for lists of changes

## Assessment Criteria Matching

When content matches an assessment criterion, add a tag like `[P2 - 80%]` where:
- P2 is the criterion ID from Assesment-criteria.md
- 80% is your confidence that this serves as good evidence for that criterion

Only add tags when there's a strong match. Don't force matches.

## Output

Append a new section to `./docs/report.md` with:
- A heading describing the feature/change
- Brief explanation of what was done and why
- Code snippets or diagrams if helpful
- Assessment criteria tags where applicable
