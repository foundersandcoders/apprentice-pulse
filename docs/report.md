# Creating the project (Boilerplate)
I created the boiler plate code, basic CI and deployment at the very beggining off the project (AP-3, AP-2, AP-8).
The idea is to have as soon as possible a "Hello world". In this context that would be a deployed sveltkit app that can read and write a value on Airtable.
