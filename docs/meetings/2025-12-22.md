# Meeting - 22-12-2025

## Attendees
- Jessica Jeffery
- Alexander Rodriguez

## Agenda
- Discuss the sources of data
- Explore simplification/refactoring opportunities for Airtable tables
- Propose workflows for the new platform

## Discussion Notes
- **Learner Feedback base** will be deprecated and removed
- Surveys will be consolidated into the **Weekly Learning Log** table only
- Survey timing: No need to link surveys to events directly - they will be triggered on the same day as events but remain independent
- Created new view: `Learners -> Cohorts` (Table ID: `tbllAnSw8VPYFAa1a`) -> "Cohort for Alex" - establishes links between students and cohorts
- `Progress Reviews (Apprentices)` + `Progress Reviews (Employer Feedback)` will be merged into a single **Progress Reviews** table
- On Apprentices table: add 5 hardcoded Progress Review slots per apprentice with **Status** field for each
- Add **Create Review** button that:
  1. Creates a new row in Progress Reviews table
  2. Sends email to employer with feedback form
  3. Sends email to apprentice with feedback form
  4. Updates status as responses come in
- Status values: Not Sent, Sent, Apprentice Answered, Employer Answered, Both Answered
- Progress Review workflow: Jess adds notes -> AI compiles notes + apprentice comments -> generates Google Doc -> platform notifies Jess -> Jess approves -> sent to Yoti for e-signatures (apprentice + line manager)
