| # | Assessment Criteria | Associated KSBs |
|---|---------------------|-----------------|
| | **Pass Criteria** |  |
| P1 | Explains the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project. | K2 |
| P2 | Outlines how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately. | K6 |
| P3 | Outlines and applies the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. | K9, S16 |
| P4 | Reviews methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and applies a justified approach to software development. | K11, S11, S12 |
| P5 | Creates logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. | S1 |
| P6 | Analyses unit testing results and reviews the outcomes correcting errors. | S4 |
| P7 | Identifies and creates test scenarios which satisfy the project specification. | S6 |
| P8 | Applies structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code. | S7 |
| P9 | Reviews and justifies their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification. | S10 |
| P10 | Establishes a logical thinking approach to areas of work which require valid reasoning and/or justified decision making. | B2 |
| P11 | Describes how they have maintained a productive, professional and secure working environment throughout the project activity. | B3 |
| | **Distinction Criteria** |  |
| D1 | Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution. | K6 |
| D2 | Evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of different coding and programming techniques to create logical and maintainable code. | S1 |
| D3 | Analyses the software to identify and debug complex issues using a fix that provides a permanent solution. | S7 |
| D4 | Evaluates different software development approaches in order justifying the best alignment with a given paradigm (for example, object oriented, event driven or procedural). | S11 |
